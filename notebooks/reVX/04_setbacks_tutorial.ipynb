If we computed boolean exclusions (i.e. pixel = 1 for excluded and 0 for included), we would overestimate the amount of land excluded due to this setback. Instead, what we can do is compute a _partial inclusion_ raster, where values represent the fraction of the pixel that is *included* (i.e. 0 = fully excluded, 1 = fully included, 0.5 = half excluded, half included, etc.). To do this, we can specify a `weights_calculation_upscale_factor` in the input to the `run` function. This value should be an integer that will ultimately determine how fine the fractional output values are. Note that setting this value too large may cause your program to run out of memory. A good run of thumb is to set it to some value <= 10."
